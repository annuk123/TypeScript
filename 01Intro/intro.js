////What is TypeScript?
// TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language.
// TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that you can catch errors and bugs before your code runs.
// TypeScript is a compiled language, which means that you write TypeScript and then compile it to JavaScript before running it.
// TypeScript is a language that is developed and maintained by Microsoft.
// TypeScript is a language that is used by many companies, including Google, Facebook, and Netflix.
//Why use TypeScript?
// TypeScript is a language that is designed to help you write better code.
// TypeScript is a language that is designed to help you catch errors and bugs before your code runs.
// TypeScript is a language that is designed to help you write more maintainable and scalable code.
// TypeScript is a language that is designed to help you write more readable and understandable code.
//When you run the tsc 01intro.ts command, it compiles the TypeScript file (01intro.ts) into a JavaScript file (01intro.js) because TypeScript must be converted (or "transpiled") into JavaScript.
//The TypeScript compiler (tsc) is a command-line tool that is used to compile TypeScript files into JavaScript files.
//The TypeScript compiler (tsc) is a command-line tool that is installed when you install TypeScript.
//To install TypeScript, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer.
//To install TypeScript, you need to have npm installed on your computer.
//To install TypeScript, you need to run the npm install -g typescript command in your terminal.
//To compile a TypeScript file, you need to run the tsc command followed by the name of the TypeScript file.
//Why 01intro.js is created?
//The TypeScript compiler (tsc) compiles the TypeScript file (01intro.ts) into a JavaScript file (01intro.js) because TypeScript must be converted (or "transpiled") into JavaScript.
//TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning the browser or Node.js can't directly understand TypeScript code. The TypeScript Compiler (tsc) is used to convert .ts files (TypeScript) into .js files (JavaScript) that can run in any JavaScript environment.
//TypeScript compiles the code from intro.ts (TypeScript) to intro.js (JavaScript). The .js file is the result of the TypeScript compiler generating valid JavaScript.
//No Errors: If the TypeScript file has no type errors, it will produce the .js file successfully. The .js file contains JavaScript code that is equivalent to the TypeScript code but without any of the TypeScript-specific syntax (like types).
//Errors: If the TypeScript file has type errors, the TypeScript compiler will display an error message in the terminal and will not produce the .js file. You need to fix the type errors before you can compile the TypeScript file.
//Why TypeScript Creates a Separate .js File?
//TypeScript creates a separate .js file because the browser or Node.js can't directly understand TypeScript code. The TypeScript Compiler (tsc) is used to convert .ts files (TypeScript) into .js files (JavaScript) that can run in any JavaScript environment.
//What is the Purpose of TypeScript?
//The purpose of TypeScript is to help you write better code by catching errors and bugs before your code runs. TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that you can catch errors and bugs at compile time instead of at runtime. This can help you write more maintainable and scalable code.
